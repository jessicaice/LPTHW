Write down all the words and code I have learned so far:

print -> displays whatever you tell it to display
# -> creates a comment
+ -> plus
- -> minus
/ -> slash
* -> percent
< -> less than
> -> greater than
<= -> less than or equal
>= -> greater than or equal
% -> used to put a variable in a string 
%r -> for the raw input from a variable
%d -> for a digit
%s -> for a string
"x" * 10 -> prints 10 x's
\n -> to start a new line
"x" -> creates a string that can be printed
""" -> creates a string with multiple lines
\t -> tab
\\ -> if you want to print a slash
raw_input() -> allows an individual to input information into the code
from -> tells where to import a library
import -> says to import some library
(from sys import argv)
(from os.path import exists)
argv -> a library where you can input variables in the command line
txt.read() -> reads a file
open() -> opens a file
open(x, 'w') -> opens file x in write mode
open(x, 'a') -> opens file x in append mode
open(x, 'r') -> opens file x is read mode
close() -> closes a file
readline() -> reads a line from a file
truncate() -> empties the file
write('stuff') -> writes things into the file
def x(y, z): -> defines a function x with variables y and z
	stuff -> defines the stuff the function does
seek() -> finds a specific byte in the file
+= -> recreates the variable with an addition
	



variables
